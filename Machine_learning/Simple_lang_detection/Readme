This mini project is done based on the concepts of natural language processing(NLP) this task will helps us to identify the languages based on the input texts 
given in it by transforming the text data into numerical format that can be processed by the machine learning algorithms these are the steps involved for the 
language detection
1.preprocessing data
2.Vectorizing the text data
3.Training the machine learning model
4.predicitng the language
