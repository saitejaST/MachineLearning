K-means clustering is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm in which the data is classified into groups based on their similarity .this works by iteratively
partitioning the data into K-clusters. where k is user-defined parameters.Basic-idea behind k-means clustering is to minimize the sum of squared distances
between each point and assigned centroid
